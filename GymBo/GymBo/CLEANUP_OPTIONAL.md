# Optional Cleanup

## Non-Critical Files to Remove

These files were created by Xcode's default template but aren't needed for GymBo V2:

### Item.swift
- Location: `GymBo/Item.swift`
- This is a default SwiftData template file
- **Safe to delete** - not used anywhere in V2

**To delete:**
1. Select `Item.swift` in Project Navigator
2. Right-click → Delete
3. Choose "Move to Trash"

---

This is optional - the file won't cause any issues if left in the project.
